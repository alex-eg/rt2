<2016-04-12 Tue> Work started.

* General Plan:
  1 SDL window, CPU raytracing of sphere and plane
  1.1 cmdline argument parser
  2 Box rendering
  3 Voxel rendering
  4 Voxel generation
  5 Deside on Lisp. Pico? Full Common? ECL?

Are sunbmodules evil? And where to store dev documentation?
 - submodule
 - gh wiki
 - right in the repo
